### About This Project

This project introduces a second interpreter for the Lox programming language, moving beyond the simple tree-walk interpreter (jlox) to a more efficient bytecode-based implementation (clox). While jlox is straightforward and portable, it suffers from significant performance limitations due to its reliance on abstract syntax tree (AST) traversal. This design results in inefficiencies like poor memory locality and excessive overhead from object pointers.

In contrast, clox uses bytecode, a compact, linear sequence of instructions that balances simplicity, portability, and performance. Bytecode offers a faster alternative to AST traversal without the complexity of compiling directly to native machine code. By implementing a virtual machine (VM) in C, clox interprets this bytecode efficiently while maintaining cross-platform compatibility.

The transition to a bytecode-based VM unlocks several advantages:
- **Improved Performance**: Bytecode reduces the memory overhead and inefficiencies of tree-walk interpreters.
- **Portability**: The VM, written in C, can run on any platform with a C compiler.
- **Extensibility**: The design mirrors modern language implementations like Python, Lua, and Ruby, enabling future optimizations.

This repository includes the full implementation of the clox interpreter, with step-by-step documentation on its architecture, from lexing and parsing to bytecode generation and execution. Whether you're interested in building programming languages or understanding interpreter design, this project provides a solid foundation.
